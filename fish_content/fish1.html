		<h1>The Devil's Hole Pupfish</h1>
		<p>
            The Devil's Hole Pupfish is a tiny, strikingly blue fish found only in the limestone caverns of Nevada's Death Valley National Park. 
			Adapted to survive in the extreme conditions of its habitat, with temperatures soaring above 90°F (32°C) and oxygen levels fluctuating, 
			this species faces imminent extinction due to its highly specialized ecological niche. Conservation efforts, 
			including habitat protection and controlled breeding programs, are crucial for the survival of the Devil's Hole Pupfish, 
			which serves as a unique indicator of the health of desert aquifers.
