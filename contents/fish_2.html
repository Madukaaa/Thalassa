		<h1>The Chinese Paddlefish</h1>
		<p>The Chinese Paddlefish, once found in the Yangtze River basin, is believed to be functionally extinct. 
            With a lineage dating back millions of years, this enormous freshwater fish, known for its elongated paddle-like snout, 
            succumbed to habitat loss, pollution, and overfishing. Efforts to find surviving individuals have been unsuccessful, 
            highlighting the urgent need for conservation measures to protect other species in the Yangtze ecosystem.</p>
