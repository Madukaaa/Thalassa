                        <p>
                            Around the world, fishing is an essential source of food and nourishment for communities, as well as a means of subsistence. 
                            38 million people work in wild capture fisheries, and seafood is the primary source of protein for over a third of the world is population.
                            We can help end hunger and poverty and ensure food for the future by practicing sustainable fishing.But excessive bycatch, unrestricted fishing, 
                            and overfishing are examples of unsustainable fishing methods that endanger our oceans.The demand for seafood is rising worldwide, and over a third of the world is fisheries have been overfished. 
                            Sustainable fishing has the potential to stop this decrease and guarantee that there are enough fish in the ocean for fishing to continue for a very long time.
                            For the purpose of providing a growing population with a nutrient-rich food source,
                             the long-term health of fish populations is also essential.

                        Every region is large coastal inhabitants rely on them for their prosperity and means of subsistence. 
                        In addition, the oceans support an abundance of marine life, provide half of the oxygen humans breathe, and regulate the climate, 
                        among other invaluable environmental functions. However, despite their vital importance, the increasing effects of marine pollution, overfishing, 
                        and climate change—including ocean acidification—threaten to impede efforts to conserve the world is seas. The most vulnerable developing states are small island nations. Oceans are transboundary, 
                        thus managing marine resources necessitates actions at all levels—national, regional, and international—to reduce risks.

                            had long applied to the oceans. The other oceans were proclaimed to belong to no one and to everyone. Although this state of affairs persisted until the middle of the 20th century, 
                            there was pressure to expand national claims to offshore resources by the middle of the century.The Law of the Sea Convention, which was adopted by the UN in 1982,
